Signals through adaptable fabrics - Capacitive &amp; Temperature Sensing

This project focused on the development of adaptable fabrics made with conductive fiber that have capacitive sensing and/or temperature sensing capabilities. These fabrics can be used in a variety of applications, including personal devices, furniture upholstery, and interior architecture. The goal is to create fabrics that can be used on multiple scales and in a variety of settings.

Different iterations of a sensing and messaging system using the Espressif esp32 and WhatsApp's API have been developed for use in personal devices, furniture, and interior architecture. Users can send predefined messages to recipients through personalized gestures, such as a single tap, double tap, left swipe, right swipe, etc. This is achieved through the use of capacitive sensing conductive fiber.

## Code
Esp32_Capacitive_Whatsapp: This arduino code implements capacitive sensing using the ESP_CapSense library and the Espressif esp32. The code also sends messages through WhatsApp's API. Reference: [Rui Santos](https://RandomNerdTutorials.com/esp32-send-messages-whatsapp/)
